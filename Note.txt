Accessing a Bucket
You can access your bucket using the Amazon S3 console. Using the console UI, you can perform almost all bucket operations without having to write any code.

If you access a bucket programmatically, note that Amazon S3 supports RESTful architecture in which your buckets and objects are resources, each with a resource URI that uniquely identifies the resource.

Amazon S3 supports both virtual-hosted–style and path-style URLs to access a bucket.

In a virtual-hosted–style URL, the bucket name is part of the domain name in the URL. For example:  

http://bucket.s3.amazonaws.com

http://bucket.s3-aws-region.amazonaws.com.

In a virtual-hosted–style URL, you can use either of these endpoints. If you make a request to the http://bucket.s3.amazonaws.com endpoint, the DNS has sufficient information to route your request directly to the Region where your bucket resides.
